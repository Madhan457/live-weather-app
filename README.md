🌤️ Weather App

A responsive weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays essential weather information for any searched city.

Users can enter a city name and instantly view the current temperature (in Celsius 🌡️), humidity percentage 💧, and wind speed 🌬️. The weather icon dynamically updates based on conditions like Clear ☀️, Clouds ☁️, Rain 🌧️, or Snow ❄️.

This project demonstrates clean UI design, proper input validation, and modern JavaScript concepts such as async/await and the Fetch API. It also includes error handling for invalid city names and supports searching using both a button click and the Enter key ⌨️.
